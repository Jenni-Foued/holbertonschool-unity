# 0x05. Unity - Assets: Models, Textures

This is a simple 3D platformer game.

## About The Project

A platformer is a video game in which the game-play revolves heavily around players controlling a character who runs and jumps onto platforms, floors, ledges, stairs, or other objects depicted on a single or scrolling (horizontal or vertical) game screen. Though similar to it, this is not the same as an auto-runner game. It is frequently classified as a sub-genre of action games.

## Built With
